# Python Service Image Enhancement Implementation

## Overview
Added image pre-processing to the face recognition service using OpenCV. This improves recognition accuracy by enhancing contrast and brightness before processing.

## Changes Made
- Added OpenCV for image enhancement
- Increased contrast (alpha=1.2) and brightness (beta=40)
- Applied enhancement before face detection
- Maintained fast processing times

## Code Changes
```python
# Before
image_array = np.frombuffer(image_bytes, np.uint8)
image_bgr = cv2.imdecode(image_array, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

# After
image_array = np.frombuffer(image_bytes, np.uint8)
image_bgr = cv2.imdecode(image_array, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
image_bgr = cv2.convertScaleAbs(image_bgr, alpha=1.2, beta=40)
```

## Benefits
- Improved contrast for better face detection
- Enhanced image quality in low-light conditions
- Minimal impact on processing time
