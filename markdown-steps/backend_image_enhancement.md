# Backend Image Enhancement Implementation

## Overview
Added image quality enhancement to the streaming endpoint using the Sharp library. This improves face recognition accuracy by enhancing image contrast and quality before processing.

## Changes Made
- Added Sharp library for image processing
- Enhanced image quality with 90% JPEG quality
- Reduced image noise and improved contrast
- Updated response message to indicate enhancement

## Code Changes
```javascript
// Before
await fsp.writeFile(filePath, req.body);

// After
const enhancedBuffer = await sharp(req.body)
  .jpeg({ quality: 90 })
  .toBuffer();
  
await fsp.writeFile(filePath, enhancedBuffer);
```

## Benefits
- Improved face recognition accuracy
- Better image quality for storage and display
- Minimal performance impact
